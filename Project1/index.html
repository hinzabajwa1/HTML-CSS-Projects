          <h2>Pakistani Humanitarian
          </h2>
          <p><b>Abdul Sattar Edhi</b> (1 January 1928 â€“ 8 July 2016) was a renowned Pakistani philanthropist, social activist, and humanitarian who founded the Edhi Foundation, the largest and most respected welfare organization in Pakistan. Born in Bantva, Gujarat, British India, Edhi migrated to Pakistan after the partition in 1947. Starting with a small dispensary in Karachi, he dedicated his life to serving humanity, providing free medical care, shelter for the homeless, and emergency relief services. Edhi's organization operates the world's largest volunteer ambulance service, along with orphanages, hospitals, and rehabilitation centers. His unwavering commitment to helping the poor and needy, regardless of race, religion, or nationality, earned him the title "Angel of Mercy." Despite his immense contributions, Edhi lived a life of simplicity, devoting all his resources to the welfare of others. His legacy continues to inspire countless individuals worldwide.</p>
