        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that
            allows you to create dynamically updating content, control
            multimedia, animate images, and much more. It is a core technology
            of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript is widely
            used for web development and is a key tool for building interactive
            websites and web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript runs directly in the browser, which means it doesn't need
            to be compiled, making it accessible for beginners. It's essential
            for adding functionality like form validation, user interactions,
            and event handling.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

            Before starting with JavaScript, you should have a basic
            understanding of the following concepts:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>HTML</b>: HTML is the structure of your web pages. You should
              know how to structure web documents using HTML tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>CSS</b>: You should also understand how to style your HTML
              using CSS. This will help you design web pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Basic Programming Concepts</b>: It’s useful to have a basic
              understanding of programming logic, such as variables, loops, and
              functions. This will make learning JavaScript easier.
            </li>

      <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Despite the similarity in their names, JavaScript and Java are entirely different languages, each with its own uses and strengths.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>JavaScript</b>: A scripting language used primarily for client-side development to make web pages interactive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Java</b>: A compiled, object-oriented programming language used in various applications, from desktop to mobile apps.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>JavaScript is lightweight and focuses on web development, while Java is used for larger-scale applications. They share common concepts like object-oriented programming, but their use cases are distinct.</p>

      <h2>Hello World</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          The "Hello, World!" example is the most basic program that you can write in JavaScript. It simply displays the text "Hello, World!" on a webpage.
        </p>
        <p>Here is a basic example of how to write and run a "Hello, World!" program in JavaScript:</p>
        </p>
        <code>   
      function sayHello() {
         alert('Hello, World!');}  <!-- Display "Hello, World!" in an alert box -->
         onclick="sayHello()"
        </code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section id="variables">
      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. You can declare variables using the <b>var</b>, <b>let</b>, or <b>const</b> keywords.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>var</b>: This is the traditional way of declaring variables. However, it has function scope, which can sometimes cause unexpected behavior.</li>
          <li><b>let</b>: Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), let has block scope, meaning the variable is only available within the block where it is defined. It's a better option for declaring variables inside loops or conditions.</li>
          <li><b>const</b>: Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare variables whose values won’t change. It is useful for defining constants.</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Example:</h6>
        <code>
          let name = "Alex"; 
          const age = 25; 
          console.log(name); // Output: Alex
          console.log(age); // Output: 25
        </code>
        <p>In this example, <b>name</b> is a variable that can be changed later, while <b>age</b> is a constant and cannot be changed.</p>
